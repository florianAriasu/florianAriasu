## Professional Overview  

I'm Florian, an undergraduate Computer Science student specialising in DevOps practices and software development. My focus areas include cloud computing, automation, and scalable infrastructure.

I have experience with Linux environments, Git-based version control, and shell scripting (Bash/Zsh). Having implemented automation workflows with GitHub Actions, I am deepening my expertise in CI/CD practices. My goal is to build comprehensive proficiency in DevOps and software engineering, emphasising automation, scalability, and efficient development methodologies.
